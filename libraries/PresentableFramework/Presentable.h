/*
 * A Presentable is a special type of Feature that can present its feature and also host other Presentables so they can present their own features.
 * There are five stages in the Presentable lifecycle.
 * 1: `Inactive`: All Presentables start their life here as they wait to be presented. Once a Presentable has been presented, it will transition to
 * the Presentation stage. Any action sent to an inactive Presentable will be ignored.
 * 2: `Presentation`: Is the main stage where the Presentable will present its Feature until it chooses to host another Presentable or is dismissed
 * when the feature is complete. If the Presentable opts to host a guest Presentable, then `host(Presentable* guest)` should be called which will
 * transition the Presentable to the Hosting stage and allow the guest to present. When the Feature is complete and ready to be dismissed,
 * `completePresentation()` should be called which will advance the Presentable to the Dismissing stage. Actions sent to the Presentable during the
 * Presentation stage will trigger one of the following Action methods to execute: `leftAction()`, `rightAction()`, `selectAction()`.
 * 3: `Hosting`: Is an optional stage where the Presentable acts as a host for another Presentable called the guest. Hosting a guest means that the
 * host will give control to the guest and allow the guest to present its own feature. Control will be returned to the host when the guest is
 * dismissed. During the Hosting stage, any Actions sent to the host will be transported to the guest that is presenting.
 * 4: `Dismissing`: Is the final stage in the Presentable lifecycle which allows the Presentable a chance to perform any last minute cleanup tasks in
 * `presentableWillDismiss()`. When a Presentable is dismissed, it will become inactive and wait until it is called to present again.
 * 5: `Error`: TODO: I'm not entirely sure I want to include this as a stage in the Presentable lifecycle. I think it fits better as part of a
 * Feature. Let's give this some more thought and revisit this later.
